This repository is designed for testing GitHub Copilot functionality and capabilities.

## Purpose

This project serves as a testing ground to evaluate and demonstrate various GitHub Copilot features, including:

- Code completion and suggestions
- Documentation generation
- Code refactoring assistance
- Bug detection and fixes
- Test case generation

## Getting Started

1. Create new files and test Copilot's code suggestions
2. Write comments and let Copilot generate code
3. Refactor existing code with Copilot's assistance
4. Generate documentation and tests

### Example Files

The repository includes several example files to demonstrate Copilot functionality:

- `examples.js` - JavaScript functions demonstrating basic operations
- `examples.py` - Python functions with similar functionality
- `test_examples.py` - Python test suite demonstrating test generation

### Running Examples

To run the Python examples:
```bash
python3 examples.py
```

To run the tests:
